# Lights_ON
The project is an interactive website with a button that controls the lights. When the user clicks the button, the lights on the webpage will turn on, creating a bright and vibrant display. Clicking the button again will switch the lights off, providing a dynamic visual experience. This engaging project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
